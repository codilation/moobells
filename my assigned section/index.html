	<h1>WHY CHOOSE OUR BÃ†LLS?</h1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h2>Home grown:</h2>
	<p>We know cows better than literally anyone else.
	<br>We practically made cows! We actually made cows!<br>In our laboratory. So that we didn't have to buy cows.<br>Science? We know it.<br>Ethics? Don't need it.</p><br>

	<h2>Enviromentally friendly:</h2>
	<p>Our bells are enviromentally friendly, in a different way.<br>Our cows are not. Not our fault though, it's cows.</p><br>
	
	<h2>First class shipping:</h2>
	<p>We literally charge you for a seat in first class just for the cow bell.<br>The bell takes up a seat. Economic!</p><br>
	
	<h2>The highest prices:</h2>
	<p>We deal with luxery goods that can cause extreme injury to thousands, so most of our profits go to legal fees.</p><br>
	
	<h2>We know where you live:</h2>
	<p>This isn't a threat :).</p>
